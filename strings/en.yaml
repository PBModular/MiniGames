cock:
  event:
    micro:
      - "Catastrophe! {user}, your proud member has shriveled to a mere 0.1cm. Is that a dust bunny, or...?"
      - "Tragedy strikes! {user}, your cock has undergone extreme downsizing to 0.1cm. You'll need a microscope for that!"
      - "Honey, I shrunk the... {user}! It's now a microscopic 0.1cm. At least it's... dainty?"
      - "Oh, the humanity! {user}, your once-mighty johnson is now a pitiable 0.1cm. You could probably use it as a toothpick."
    rubber:
      message:
        - "Congratulations, {user}! You've been 'blessed' with a RUBBER COCK for {duration} rounds! It'll flop to a new random size each time. Unpredictable, just like life... or a cheap prosthetic."
        - "Wibble wobble! {user}, your cock has turned into pure, unadulterated RUBBER for {duration} turns! Expect wild fluctuations and a distinct lack of rigidity."
        - "Oh, what's this? {user}, your member is now made of bouncy, unpredictable RUBBER for {duration} rounds! Its size will be a surprise every time. Fun, right?"
      change:
        - "Boiyoiyoing! Your rubber cock wobbled and is now {new_length} cm! Only {remain} more moves of this flaccid fun."
        - "Sproing! The rubbery wonder settled at {new_length} cm. {remain} rounds of wobbly destiny await."
        - "Thwack! Your unpredictable appendage is now {new_length} cm. Keep an eye on it for {remain} more turns!"
    teleport:
      - "Emergency transplant! {user1}'s original piece was... unsatisfactory. After a dodgy back-alley swap with {user2}, {user1} now sports a dick of {user1_new_length} cm, while {user2} gets the, uh, 'experienced' model, now measuring {user2_new_length} cm. Hope you both like surprises!"
      - "Abracadabra! {user1} and {user2} have played genital musical chairs! {user1} now has a {user1_new_length} cm piece, and {user2} is rocking (or not) a {user2_new_length} cm one. Switcheroo!"
      - "Houston, we have a... swap! {user1} and {user2} just experienced a Freaky Friday, dick edition. {user1} is now the proud owner of a {user1_new_length} cm model, while {user2} inherits a {user2_new_length} cm legacy. Adjust your pants accordingly!"
    aging:
      - "Oh dear, {user}. Time makes fools of us all, and apparently, prunes of our cocks. Yours has aged poorly, shrinking by 20%! It's now a rather wrinkly {new_length} cm."
      - "Father Time is a cruel master, {user}. Your member has withered by 20%, now a sagely {new_length} cm. Dignified, perhaps?"
      - "Gravity's a harsh mistress, {user}. And so is age! Your once-proud member has succumbed to the ravages of time, shrinking by 20% to a more... 'experienced' {new_length} cm."
    rocket:
      message:
        - "WOOOSH! {user}, your cock has achieved liftoff with an initial {initial_boost} cm boost, now a staggering {new_length} cm! It's on a {duration}-turn journey to the stars... or an embarrassing crash."
        - "Prepare for launch! {user}, your cock has strapped on a rocket, gaining an instant {initial_boost} cm to reach {new_length} cm! For {duration} turns, it's aiming for the moon. Let's hope it doesn't blow up prematurely."
        - "3... 2... 1... LIFTOFF! {user}, your member is now a ROCKET COCK, soaring to {new_length} cm after a {initial_boost} cm boost! This interstellar journey lasts {duration} turns. May the G-force be with you."
      no_change:
        - "Still rocketing, {user}! Your magnificent member is holding steady at {new_length} cm. {remain} turns left on this cosmic voyage!"
        - "The ascent continues! {user}, your cock remains at an impressive {new_length} cm. {remain} more turns in orbit!"
        - "To the moon, {user}! Your rocket cock is maintaining altitude at {new_length} cm. {remain} turns before potential atmospheric explosion."
      change:
        - "KABOOM! ...or was that a sad 'pffft'? {user}, your rocket cock has spectacularly exploded. It's now a rather underwhelming {new_length} cm. Back to Earth with you."
        - "Re-entry was rough, {user}! Your rocket adventure ends with a mangled {new_length} cm. Houston, we have a problem."
        - "Oops! {user}, your rocket seems to have hit some space debris. It's now a crumpled {new_length} cm. At least you tried."
    magnetic:
      - "Zzzzap! {user}, your groin has become dangerously magnetic! You've violently yoinked {change} cm from poor {target_user}, leaving your own at a beefy {new_length} cm. Sharing is not caring today."
      - "Clang! {user}, you're a human magnet! You just snatched {change} cm from {target_user}. Your new total: {new_length} cm. Their loss, your gain!"
      - "Come to papa! {user}'s crotch just developed intense magnetic properties, ripping {change} cm from {target_user}. You're now at {new_length} cm. Hope {target_user} wasn't too attached!"
    shrink_ray:
      - "Zzzzzzzzzap! Oops, {user}, looks like you stood in front of the 'Shrink-O-Matic 5000'! Your cock is now half its former glory, a pocket-sized {new_length} cm. Cute!"
      - "BzzzzT! {user}, you've been zapped by a shrink ray! Down to {new_length} cm you go. It's fun-sized now!"
      - "Micro-penis activated! {user}, a stray shrink ray hit its mark. You're now the proud owner of a {new_length} cm pecker. Less is... well, less."
    growth_spurt:
      - "HOLY MOLY! {user}, your cock just hit puberty again! A massive Growth Spurt adds {change} cm, rocketing you to {new_length} cm! Don't get a big head... or, well, you know."
      - "KACHOW! {user}, a sudden growth spurt! You've gained {change} cm, now boasting {new_length} cm. Hulking!"
      - "It's ALIVE! And it's bigger! {user}, a miraculous growth spurt has blessed you with an extra {change} cm, bringing you to a grand total of {new_length} cm."
    phantom_shrink:
      - "A chilling breeze... {user}, a Spooky Phantom just fondled your junk and made off with {change} cm! You're now left with {new_length} cm and a sense of violation."
      - "Boo! {user}, a spectral thief swiped {change} cm from you! Now at {new_length} cm. Ghostly grand larceny!"
      - "Did you feel that? {user}, a mischievous poltergeist just pinched {change} cm from your member! You're down to {new_length} cm. Spooky!"
    black_hole:
      - "WHOA! A mini Black Hole just opened in your pants, {user}! It sucked {change} cm of your length into the void. You're now sporting a more compact {new_length} cm. Mind the singularity!"
      - "GULP! {user}, a trouser-based black hole devoured {change} cm! Your new, more concise length is {new_length} cm."
      - "Into the abyss! {user}, your member encountered a localized gravitational anomaly, losing {change} cm to the void. Now measuring {new_length} cm. Hope it didn't take anything else!"
    average_recalibration:
      - "{user}, the Bureau of Cock Standards has audited your equipment. After careful measurement against the local talent, your piece has been 're-calibrated' to the chat average of {avg_length} cm. Congratulations, you're perfectly, utterly, magnificently... average. How... normal."
      - "Standardization Protocol Activated! {user}, your member has been adjusted to the community mean of {avg_length} cm. Welcome to the median!"
      - "In the interest of fairness, {user}, your cock has been recalibrated to the chat average of {avg_length} cm. You're now a shining example of 'just right'!"
    phantom_limb:
      initial:
        - "SWEET MOTHER OF... {user}! Your cock just underwent a GARGANTUAN transformation! Our sensors are screaming it's now {fake_new_length} cm! Is this even possible?!"
        - "By the GODS! {user}, it's... it's HUGE! Reports indicate your cock has ballooned to an unbelievable {fake_new_length} cm! This changes everything!"
        - "ALERT! ALERT! {user}, your member has achieved legendary proportions! Initial readings suggest a staggering {fake_new_length} cm! We're witnessing history!"
      reveal:
        - "...PSYCH! {user}, our apologies. Turns out our sensors were just excited. It *actually* changed by a measly {tiny_real_change} cm. Details, details. Your member is, in reality, {final_real_length} cm. So much for that miracle."
        - "Correction: {user}, there was a slight... exaggeration. The actual change was {tiny_real_change} cm, resulting in {final_real_length} cm. Our bad."
        - "False alarm! {user}, the massive growth was just a trick of the light. The real change was a tiny {tiny_real_change} cm. You're now at {final_real_length} cm. Don't believe everything you see!"
    borrower:
      initial:
        - "Feeling a bit... inadequate, {user}? Fret not! The ever-so-generous (they weren't asked) {lender_user} has 'lent' you {borrowed_amount} cm of their prime meat for {duration} turns! Try not to get too attached, it's not really yours."
        - "Short on length, {user}? No problem! {lender_user} has involuntarily 'donated' {borrowed_amount} cm to you for {duration} turns. Enjoy the temporary boost!"
        - "Need a loaner? {user}, you've 'borrowed' {borrowed_amount} cm from {lender_user} for {duration} turns. Make good use of it before it's repossessed!"
      return_success:
        - "Payback's a bitch, {user}! The {amount} cm you borrowed has been surgically repossessed and successfully reattached to {lender}. Hope you enjoyed the upgrade while it lasted!"
        - "Loan repaid! {user}, the {amount} cm has been returned to {lender}. Back to your original programming!"
        - "All debts paid! {user}, the {amount} cm chunk has been restored to {lender}. It was fun while it lasted, eh?"
      return_fail_lender_gone:
        - "Time to pay up, {user}! The {amount} cm loan is due. We tried to return it to {lender}, but they've vanished! Poof! So, the borrowed bits just... dematerialized. Easy come, easy go!"
        - "Collection attempt failed for {user}! The {amount} cm loan was due to {lender}, but they've skipped town. The borrowed length has evaporated. Vanished!"
        - "Uh oh, {user}. We went to return the {amount} cm to {lender}, but they're nowhere to be found! The borrowed piece dissolved into thin air. Whoops!"
    existential_crisis:
      initial:
        - "Whoa there, {user}! Your cock has apparently achieved sentience and is now pondering the deep questions. It's currently meditating on: \"{philosophical_quote}\". Physical form is so... mundane. It's feeling rather conceptual right now."
        - "Deep thoughts, {user}! Your member has entered a philosophical trance, musing: \"{philosophical_quote}\". Size is irrelevant when you're contemplating the cosmos."
        - "{user}, your penis is having an identity crisis! It's lost in thought, wondering: \"{philosophical_quote}\". It might be a while."
      quotes:
        - "Why are we here... attached to this human?"
        - "Is bigger always better, or is it the motion of the ocean... of consciousness?"
        - "To throb, or not to throb, that is the question."
        - "I think, therefore I... am... a cock?"
        - "My existence is a paradox wrapped in fleshy enigma."
        - "What if the real treasure was the friends we made along the way... and not just size?"
        - "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does my length matter?"
      resolve:
        - "Ah, {user}, your cock has returned from its philosophical retreat, hopefully with some enlightenment. It's now a more tangible {new_length} cm. Welcome back to the material world, little guy!"
        - "The existential journey concludes! {user}, your member is back from the void, settling at {new_length} cm. Hopefully, it found some answers."
        - "Snapping back to reality! {user}, your cock has finished its navel-gazing and is now {new_length} cm. Back to business!"
    humblebrag_tax:
      payer_msg:
        - "Well, well, {user}, aren't you the cock of the walk with that impressive member! The Cockmunity Chest has decided your flagrant display of endowment requires a 'Humblebrag Tax' of {tax_amount} cm. Consider it a donation to the less fortunate."
        - "Showing off, {user}? That's a fine of {tax_amount} cm! The 'Humblebrag Tax' is now in effect. Share the wealth!"
        - "Look at Mr./Ms. Big Shot! {user}, your impressive size has attracted the taxman. Cough up {tax_amount} cm for the 'Humblebrag Tax'!"
      recipient_single_msg:
        - "{recipient_user} is the lucky beneficiary, gaining {amount} cm from your 'generosity'!"
        - "The windfall goes to {recipient_user}, who gratefully accepts your {amount} cm 'donation'!"
        - "{recipient_user} says thanks for the {amount} cm top-up, courtesy of your 'Humblebrag Tax'!"
      recipient_multi_msg:
        - "The tax has been distributed! {recipient_list_str} each joyfully receive {amount_each} cm of your... contribution."
        - "The redistributed wealth benefits {recipient_list_str}, who each pocket a neat {amount_each} cm. Thanks, big spender!"
        - "Sharing is caring (when forced)! {recipient_list_str} have each received {amount_each} cm from your 'Humblebrag Tax'."
      tax_vanished_no_recipients:
        - "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was collected, but alas, everyone else is apparently too too proud to accept charity. The funds have mysteriously disappeared into 'administrative fees'."
        - "Taxation without representation (for the recipients)! {user}, your {tax_amount} cm tax found no takers and has vanished into the ether."
        - "Well, this is awkward. {user}, we collected your {tax_amount} cm tax, but couldn't find anyone needy enough. It's... gone. Poof."
      tax_vanished_too_small_split:
        - "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was levied, but splitting it among the needy resulted in such pitiful amounts it wasn't worth the paperwork. It's been... 'reinvested'."
        - "A noble gesture, {user}, but your {tax_amount} cm tax, when divided, was too small to matter. The funds were 'lost in rounding'."
        - "{user}, we tried to split your {tax_amount} cm tax, but the shares were too tiny. The money has been used for... 'operational costs'."
    confession:
      prompt:
        - "A strange urge overcomes you, {user}! You feel a confession brewing. Reveal it the next time you use /cock by typing `/cock [your confession]`."
        - "The truth wants out, {user}! A confession is bubbling up. Share it with `/cock [your confession]` on your next turn."
        - "Spill the beans, {user}! A deep, dark secret is yearning for release. Confess with `/cock [your confession]` next time!"
      accepted:
        - "Ah, {user}, a bold confession: '{confession}'! The spirits are... amused. Your cock size remains unchanged by this revelation (this time!)."
        - "Well, that's off your chest, {user}! Confession: '{confession}'. The universe notes your candor. No size change for now."
        - "The truth is revealed! {user} confesses: '{confession}'. The cock gods acknowledge your honesty. No change in length today."
      missed:
        - "{user}, you were supposed to confess with `/cock [your confession]`! The urge passes... for now. No change from that."
        - "Opportunity missed, {user}! The confessional moment has passed. No confession, no related change."
        - "Silence isn't always golden, {user}. You missed your chance to confess! Maybe next time. No size alteration."
      recall: "\nP.S. Hey {user}, remember when you confessed: '{past_confession}'? Good times. The cock gods remember too."

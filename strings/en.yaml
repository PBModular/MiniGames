cock:
  event:
    micro:
      - "Catastrophe! {user}, your proud member has shriveled to a mere 0.1cm. Is that a dust bunny, or...?"
      - "Tragedy strikes! {user}, your cock has undergone extreme downsizing to 0.1cm. You'll need a microscope for that!"
      - "Honey, I shrunk the... {user}! It's now a microscopic 0.1cm. At least it's... dainty?"
    rubber: 
      message: "Congratulations, {user}! You've been 'blessed' with a RUBBER COCK for {duration} rounds! It'll flop to a new random size each time. Unpredictable, just like life... or a cheap prosthetic."
      change:
        - "Boiyoiyoing! Your rubber cock wobbled and is now {new_length} cm! Only {remain} more moves of this flaccid fun."
        - "Sproing! The rubbery wonder settled at {new_length} cm. {remain} rounds of wobbly destiny await."
        - "Thwack! Your unpredictable appendage is now {new_length} cm. Keep an eye on it for {remain} more turns!"
    teleport:
      - "Emergency transplant! {user1}'s original piece was... unsatisfactory. After a dodgy back-alley swap with {user2}, {user1} now sports a dick of {user1_new_length} cm, while {user2} gets the, uh, 'experienced' model, now measuring {user2_new_length} cm. Hope you both like surprises!"
      - "Abracadabra! {user1} and {user2} have played genital musical chairs! {user1} now has a {user1_new_length} cm piece, and {user2} is rocking (or not) a {user2_new_length} cm one. Switcheroo!"
    aging:
      - "Oh dear, {user}. Time makes fools of us all, and apparently, prunes of our cocks. Yours has aged poorly, shrinking by 20%! It's now a rather wrinkly {new_length} cm."
      - "Father Time is a cruel master, {user}. Your member has withered by 20%, now a sagely {new_length} cm. Dignified, perhaps?"
    rocket:
      message: "WOOOSH! {user}, your cock has achieved liftoff with an initial {initial_boost} cm boost, now a staggering {new_length} cm! It's on a {duration}-turn journey to the stars... or an embarrassing crash."
      no_change:
        - "Still rocketing, {user}! Your magnificent member is holding steady at {new_length} cm. {remain} turns left on this cosmic voyage!"
        - "The ascent continues! {user}, your cock remains at an impressive {new_length} cm. {remain} more turns in orbit!"
      change:
        - "KABOOM! ...or was that a sad 'pffft'? {user}, your rocket cock has spectacularly exploded (or fizzled out). It's now a rather underwhelming {new_length} cm. Back to Earth with you."
        - "Re-entry was rough, {user}! Your rocket adventure ends with a mangled {new_length} cm. Houston, we have a problem."
    magnetic:
      - "Zzzzap! {user}, your groin has become dangerously magnetic! You've violently yoinked {change} cm from poor {target_user}, leaving your own at a beefy {new_length} cm. Sharing is not caring today."
      - "Clang! {user}, you're a human magnet! You just snatched {change} cm from {target_user}. Your new total: {new_length} cm. Their loss, your gain!"
    shrink_ray:
      - "Zzzzzzzzzap! Oops, {user}, looks like you stood in front of the 'Shrink-O-Matic 5000'! Your cock is now half its former glory, a pocket-sized {new_length} cm. Cute!"
      - "BzzzzT! {user}, you've been zapped by a shrink ray! Down to {new_length} cm you go. It's fun-sized now!"
    growth_spurt:
      - "HOLY MOLY! {user}, your cock just hit puberty again! A massive Growth Spurt adds {change} cm, rocketing you to {new_length} cm! Don't get a big head... or, well, you know."
      - "KACHOW! {user}, a sudden growth spurt! You've gained {change} cm, now boasting {new_length} cm. Hulking!"
    phantom_shrink:
      - "A chilling breeze... {user}, a Spooky Phantom just fondled your junk and made off with {change} cm! You're now left with {new_length} cm and a sense of violation."
      - "Boo! {user}, a spectral thief swiped {change} cm from you! Now at {new_length} cm. Ghostly grand larceny!"
    black_hole:
      - "WHOA! A mini Black Hole just opened in your pants, {user}! It sucked {change} cm of your length into the void. You're now sporting a more compact {new_length} cm. Mind the singularity!"
      - "GULP! {user}, a trouser-based black hole devoured {change} cm! Your new, more concise length is {new_length} cm."
    average_recalibration:
      - "{user}, the Bureau of Cock Standards has audited your equipment. After careful measurement against the local talent, your piece has been 're-calibrated' to the chat average of {avg_length} cm. Congratulations, you're perfectly, utterly, magnificently... average. How... normal."
      - "Standardization Protocol Activated! {user}, your member has been adjusted to the community mean of {avg_length} cm. Welcome to the median!"
    phantom_limb:
      initial:
        - "SWEET MOTHER OF... {user}! Your cock just underwent a GARGANTUAN transformation! Our sensors are screaming it's now {fake_new_length} cm! Is this even possible?!"
        - "By the GODS! {user}, it's... it's HUGE! Reports indicate your cock has ballooned to an unbelievable {fake_new_length} cm! This changes everything!"
      reveal:
        - "...PSYCH! {user}, our apologies. Turns out our sensors were just excited. It *actually* changed by a measly {tiny_real_change} cm. Details, details. Your member is, in reality, {final_real_length} cm. So much for that miracle."
        - "Correction: {user}, there was a slight... exaggeration. The actual change was {tiny_real_change} cm, resulting in {final_real_length} cm. Our bad."
    borrower:
      initial:
        - "Feeling a bit... inadequate, {user}? Fret not! The ever-so-generous (they weren't asked) {lender_user} has 'lent' you {borrowed_amount} cm of their prime meat for {duration} turns! Try not to get too attached, it's not really yours."
        - "Short on length, {user}? No problem! {lender_user} has involuntarily 'donated' {borrowed_amount} cm to you for {duration} turns. Enjoy the temporary boost!"
      return_success:
        - "Payback's a bitch, {user}! The {amount} cm you borrowed has been surgically repossessed and successfully reattached to {lender}. Hope you enjoyed the upgrade while it lasted!"
        - "Loan repaid! {user}, the {amount} cm has been returned to {lender}. Back to your original programming!"
      return_fail_lender_gone:
        - "Time to pay up, {user}! The {amount} cm loan is due. We tried to return it to {lender}, but they've vanished! Poof! So, the borrowed bits just... dematerialized. Easy come, easy go!"
        - "Collection attempt failed for {user}! The {amount} cm loan was due to {lender}, but they've skipped town. The borrowed length has evaporated. Vanished!"
    existential_crisis:
      initial:
        - "Whoa there, {user}! Your cock has apparently achieved sentience and is now pondering the deep questions. It's currently meditating on: \"{philosophical_quote}\". Physical form is so... mundane. It's feeling rather conceptual right now."
        - "Deep thoughts, {user}! Your member has entered a philosophical trance, musing: \"{philosophical_quote}\". Size is irrelevant when you're contemplating the cosmos."
      quotes:
        - "Why are we here... attached to this human?"
        - "Is bigger always better, or is it the motion of the ocean... of consciousness?"
        - "To throb, or not to throb, that is the question."
        - "I think, therefore I... am... a cock?"
        - "My existence is a paradox wrapped in fleshy enigma."
        - "What if the real treasure was the friends we made along the way... and not just size?"
      resolve:
        - "Ah, {user}, your cock has returned from its philosophical retreat, hopefully with some enlightenment (or at least its physical form). It's now a more tangible {new_length} cm. Welcome back to the material world, little guy!"
        - "The existential journey concludes! {user}, your member is back from the void, settling at {new_length} cm. Hopefully, it found some answers."
    humblebrag_tax:
      payer_msg:
        - "Well, well, {user}, aren't you the cock of the walk with that impressive member! The Cockmunity Chest has decided your flagrant display of endowment requires a 'Humblebrag Tax' of {tax_amount} cm. Consider it a donation to the less fortunate."
        - "Showing off, {user}? That's a fine of {tax_amount} cm! The 'Humblebrag Tax' is now in effect. Share the wealth!"
      recipient_single_msg: "{recipient_user} is the lucky beneficiary, gaining {amount} cm from your 'generosity'!"
      recipient_multi_msg: "The tax has been distributed! {recipient_list_str} each joyfully receive {amount_each} cm of your... contribution."
      tax_vanished_no_recipients:
        - "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was collected, but alas, everyone else is apparently too well-off (or perhaps too proud) to accept charity. The funds have mysteriously disappeared into 'administrative fees'."
        - "Taxation without representation (for the recipients)! {user}, your {tax_amount} cm tax found no takers and has vanished into the ether."
      tax_vanished_too_small_split:
        - "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was levied, but splitting it among the needy resulted in such pitiful amounts it wasn't worth the paperwork. It's been... 'reinvested'."
        - "A noble gesture, {user}, but your {tax_amount} cm tax, when divided, was too small to matter. The funds were 'lost in rounding'."
    confession:
      prompt:
        - "A strange urge overcomes you, {user}! You feel a confession brewing. Reveal it the next time you use /cock by typing `/cock [your confession]`."
        - "The truth wants out, {user}! A confession is bubbling up. Share it with `/cock [your confession]` on your next turn."
      accepted:
        - "Ah, {user}, a bold confession: '{confession}'! The spirits are... amused. Your cock size remains unchanged by this revelation (this time!)."
        - "Well, that's off your chest, {user}! Confession: '{confession}'. The universe notes your candor. No size change for now."
      missed:
        - "{user}, you were supposed to confess with `/cock [your confession]`! The urge passes... for now. No change from that."
        - "Opportunity missed, {user}! The confessional moment has passed. No confession, no related change."
      recall: "\nP.S. Hey {user}, remember when you confessed: '{past_confession}'? Good times."

  join:

      - "Whoa, keen bean! You've already joined. Your current piece is awaiting your command."
    ok:
      - "Alright, {user}, you're in! You've bravely whipped out a standard-issue {default_size} cm penis. Let's see what you make of it!"
      - "Welcome to the game, {user}! Your starting equipment: one {default_size} cm cock. May it serve you well (or hilariously)!"
  leave:
    ok:
      - "It's been emotional, {user}. Your cock has been respectfully (or hilariously, depending on its history) retired. You've left the game."
      - "So long, farewell, {user}! Your member has been tucked away. You are now out of the cock game."
    not_participant:
      - "Hold on, {user}! You can't leave if you never joined. No cock to delete here, buddy."
      - "Leaving what, {user}? You're not even in the game! To quit, one must first begin."
  stat:
    no_participants:
      - "This chat is a barren wasteland of cocklessness! No one's playing yet. Be the first!"
      - "Echo... echo... No cocks to be found here! Someone needs to step up and /cockjoin!"

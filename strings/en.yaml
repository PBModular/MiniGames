cock:
  event:
    micro: "Catastrophe! {user}, your proud member has shriveled to a mere 0.1cm. Is that a dust bunny, or...?"
    rubber: 
      message: "Congratulations, {user}! You've been 'blessed' with a RUBBER COCK for {duration} rounds! It'll flop to a new random size each time. Unpredictable, just like life... or a cheap prosthetic."
      change: "Boiyoiyoing! Your rubber cock wobbled and is now {change} cm! Only {remain} more moves of this flaccid fun."
    teleport: "Emergency transplant! {user1}'s original piece was... unsatisfactory. After a dodgy back-alley swap with {user2}, {user1} now sports a dick of {user1_new_length} cm, while {user2} gets the, uh, 'experienced' model, now measuring {user2_new_length} cm. Hope you both like surprises!"
    aging: "Oh dear, {user}. Time makes fools of us all, and apparently, prunes of our cocks. Yours has aged poorly, shrinking by 20%! It's now a rather wrinkly {new_length} cm."
    rocket: 
      message: "WOOOSH! {user}, your cock has achieved liftoff with an initial {initial_boost} cm boost, now a staggering {new_length} cm! It's on a {duration}-turn journey to the stars... or an embarrassing crash."
      no_change: "Still rocketing, {user}! Your magnificent member is holding steady at {new_length} cm. {remain} turns left on this cosmic voyage!"
      change: "KABOOM! ...or was that a sad 'pffft'? {user}, your rocket cock has spectacularly exploded (or fizzled out). It's now a rather underwhelming {new_length} cm. Back to Earth with you."
    magnetic: "Zzzzap! {user}, your groin has become dangerously magnetic! You've violently yoinked {change} cm from poor {target_user}, leaving your own at a beefy {new_length} cm. Sharing is not caring today."
    shrink_ray: "Zzzzzzzzzap! Oops, {user}, looks like you stood in front of the 'Shrink-O-Matic 5000'! Your cock is now half its former glory, a pocket-sized {new_length} cm. Cute!"
    growth_spurt: "HOLY MOLY! {user}, your cock just hit puberty again! A massive Growth Spurt adds {change} cm, rocketing you to {new_length} cm! Don't get a big head... or, well, you know."
    phantom_shrink: "A chilling breeze... {user}, a Spooky Phantom just fondled your junk and made off with {change} cm! You're now left with {new_length} cm and a sense of violation."
    black_hole: "WHOA! A mini Black Hole just opened in your pants, {user}! It sucked {change} cm of your length into the void. You're now sporting a more compact {new_length} cm. Mind the singularity!"
    average_recalibration: "{user}, the Bureau of Cock Standards has audited your equipment. After careful measurement against the local talent, your piece has been 're-calibrated' to the chat average of {avg_length} cm. Congratulations, you're perfectly, utterly, magnificently... average. How... normal."
    phantom_limb:
      initial: "SWEET MOTHER OF... {user}! Your cock just underwent a GARGANTUAN transformation! Our sensors are screaming it's now {fake_new_length} cm! Is this even possible?!"
      reveal: "...PSYCH! {user}, our apologies. Turns out our sensors were just excited. It *actually* changed by a measly {tiny_real_change} cm. Details, details. Your member is, in reality, {final_real_length} cm. So much for that miracle."
    borrower:
      initial: "Feeling a bit... inadequate, {user}? Fret not! The ever-so-generous (they weren't asked) {lender_user} has 'lent' you {borrowed_amount} cm of their prime meat for {duration} turns! Try not to get too attached, it's not really yours."
      return_success: "Payback's a bitch, {user}! The {amount} cm you borrowed has been surgically repossessed and successfully reattached to {lender}. Hope you enjoyed the upgrade while it lasted!"
      return_fail_lender_gone: "Time to pay up, {user}! The {amount} cm loan is due. We tried to return it to {lender}, but they've vanished! Poof! So, the borrowed bits just... dematerialized. Easy come, easy go!"
    existential_crisis:
      initial: "Whoa there, {user}! Your cock has apparently achieved sentience and is now pondering the deep questions. It's currently meditating on: \"{philosophical_quote}\". Physical form is so... mundane. It's feeling rather conceptual right now."
      quotes:
        - "Why are we here... attached to this human?"
        - "Is bigger always better, or is it the motion of the ocean... of consciousness?"
        - "To throb, or not to throb, that is the question."
        - "I think, therefore I... am... a cock?"
        - "My existence is a paradox wrapped in fleshy enigma."
        - "What if the real treasure was the friends we made along the way... and not just size?"
      resolve: "Ah, {user}, your cock has returned from its philosophical retreat, hopefully with some enlightenment (or at least its physical form). It's now a more tangible {new_length} cm. Welcome back to the material world, little guy!"
    humblebrag_tax:
      payer_msg: "Well, well, {user}, aren't you the cock of the walk with that {tax_amount} cm specimen! The Cockmunity Chest has decided your flagrant display of endowment requires a 'Humblebrag Tax'. Consider it a donation to the less fortunate."
      recipient_single_msg: "{recipient_user} is the lucky beneficiary, gaining {amount} cm from your 'generosity'!"
      recipient_multi_msg: "The tax has been distributed! {recipient_list_str} each joyfully receive {amount_each} cm of your... contribution."
      tax_vanished_no_recipients: "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was collected, but alas, everyone else is apparently too well-off (or perhaps too proud) to accept charity. The funds have mysteriously disappeared into 'administrative fees'."
      tax_vanished_too_small_split: "{user}, your {tax_amount} cm 'Humblebrag Tax' was levied, but splitting it among the needy resulted in such pitiful amounts it wasn't worth the paperwork. It's been... 'reinvested'."

  join:
    already: "Easy there, tiger! You're already in the game. One cock per customer, please."
    ok: "Alright, {user}, you're in! You've bravely whipped out a standard-issue {default_size} cm penis. Let's see what you make of it!"
  leave:
    ok: "It's been emotional, {user}. Your cock has been respectfully (or hilariously, depending on its history) retired. You've left the game."
    not_participant: "Hold on, {user}! You can't leave if you never joined. No cock to delete here, buddy."
  stat:
    no_participants: "This chat is a barren wasteland of cocklessness! No one's playing yet. Be the first!"
